# Assignment-2(**Student information system**)
### Database Table
    The SIS database consists of following tables:
* Student
* Courses
* Enrollments
* Teacher
* Payments

> **Task-1: Database design**

1. Create the database named "SISDB"
~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE [SISDB];
USE [SISDB] 
~~~
2. Define the schema for the Students, Courses, Enrollments, Teacher, and Payments tables based
on the provided schema. Write SQL scripts to create the mentioned tables with appropriate data
types, constraints, and relationships.

    a. Students

    b. Courses

    c. Enrollments

    d. Teacher

    e. Payments
~~~sql
-- Students table
CREATE TABLE Students (
  [Student_id] INT  Not Null Primary Key ,
  [first_name] Varchar(100) ,
  [last_name] Varchar(100) , 
  [date_of_birth] Date ,
  [email] Varchar (150) ,
  [phone_number] varchar(50)
  );

-- Teacher table
CREATE TABLE Teacher(
 [teacher_id] INT not null Primary Key ,
 [first_name] varchar(50) ,
 [last_name] varchar(50) ,
 [email] varchar(100)
 );

-- Courses table
CREATE TABLE Courses (
 [course_id] INT not null Primary Key ,
 [course_name] varchar(20) ,
 [credits] INT ,
 [teacher_id] INT Foreign Key References Teacher(Teacher_id)
 );

-- Enrollments table
CREATE TABLE[Enrollments] (
[enrollment_id] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
 [student_id] INT,
 [course_id] INT,
 [enrollment_date] DATE,
 FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id),
FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);

-- Payments table
CREATE Table payments(
 [payment_id] INT not null Primary Key ,
 [student_id] Int Foreign Key References Students(student_id) ,
 [amount] Deciamal(10,2) ,
 [payment_date] Date
); 
~~~
3. Create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for the database.

![image](assignment_images/ERD_1.png)

4. Create appropriate Primary Key and Foreign Key constraints for referential integrity.
    > Primary keys and foreign keys are defined above in table creation itself, ensuring referential integrity.

5. Insert at least 10 sample records into each of the following tables.
i. Students
ii. Courses
iii. Enrollments
iv. Teacher
v. Payments

~~~
7. Find the names of students who have not made any payments. Use a LEFT JOIN between the
"Students" table and the "Payments" table and filter for students with NULL payment records.
~~~sql
SELECT s.first_name,s.last_name FROM students s
LEFT JOIN payments p on p.student_id=s.student_id
WHERE p.student_id is NULL;
~~~
8. Write a query to identify courses that have no enrollments. You'll need to use a LEFT JOIN
between the "Courses" table and the "Enrollments" table and filter for courses with NULL
enrollment records.
~~~sql
SELECT c.course_id ,c.course_name FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN enrollments e on c.course_id=e.course_id 
where e.course_id is null;
~~~
9. Identify students who are enrolled in more than one course. Use a self-join on the "Enrollments"
table to find students with multiple enrollment records.
~~~sql
SELECT s.first_name,COUNT(e.enrollment_id) AS [courses_enrolled]
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
GROUP BY s.first_name
HAVING COUNT(e.course_id) > 1;

LEFT JOIN courses c ON t.teacher_id=c.teacher_id
WHERE c.teacher_id IS NULL
~~~

> **Task 4.Subquery ant its type :**

1. Write an SQL query to calculate the average number of students enrolled in each course. Use aggregate functions and subqueries to achieve this.
~~~sql
SELECT AVG(enrollment_count) AS avg_no_of_students
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS enrollment_count
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY student_id
) AS enrollment_counts;
~~~
2. Identify the student(s) who made the highest payment. Use a subquery to find the maximum payment amount and then retrieve the student(s) associated with that amount.
~~~sql
SELECT first_name AS [name_of_std],max(p.amount) AS [max_amount] FROM students s 
JOIN payments p ON s.student_id = p student_id
GROUP BY s.first_name
HAVING max(p.amount)=(SELECT  max(amount) FROM payments);
~~~
3. Retrieve a list of courses with the highest number of enrollments. Use subqueries to find the course(s) with the maximum enrollment count.
~~~sql
SELECT c.course_name, e.course_count
FROM Courses c
JOIN (
    SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) AS course_count
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY course_id
) AS e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
WHERE e.course_count = (
    SELECT MAX(course_count)
    FROM (
        SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) AS course_count
        FROM Enrollments
        GROUP BY course_id
    ) AS enrollment_counts
);

~~~
4. Calculate the total payments made to courses taught by each teacher. Use subqueries to sum payments for each teacher's courses.

FROM Teacher t
LEFT JOIN Courses c ON t.teacher_id = c.teacher_id
LEFT JOIN Payments p ON c.course_id = p.student_id
GROUP BY t.teacher_id, t.first_name, t.last_name, c.course_name
ORDER BY t.teacher_id;
~~~
5. Identify students who are enrolled in all available courses. Use subqueries to compare a student's enrollments with the total number of courses.
~~~sql

FROM Students
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT course_id)
    FROM Enrollments
    ) = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT course_id)
    FROM Courses
    );
~~~
6. Retrieve the names of teachers who have not been assigned to any courses. Use subqueries to find teachers with no course assignments.
~~~sql

WHERE teacher_id NOT IN(
	SELECT DISTINCT (teacher_id) FROM courses
);
~~~
7.  Calculate the average age of all students. Use subqueries to calculate the age of each student based on their date of birth
~~~sql
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR,date_of_birth, GETDATE())) AS average_age
FROM Students ;
~~~
8. Identify courses with no enrollments. Use subqueries to find courses without enrollment records.
~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM Courses
WHERE course_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT course_id
    FROM Enrollments
);

FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
JOIN Payments p ON s.student_id = p.student_id
GROUP BY s.student_id, c.course_id, c.course_name, s.first_name, s.last_name;
~~~
10.  Identify students who have made more than one payment. Use subqueries and aggregate functions to count payments per student and filter for those with counts greater than one.
~~~sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name
FROM Students s
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(p.payment_id)
    FROM Payments p
    WHERE p.student_id = s.student_id
) > 1;
~~~
11.  Write an SQL query to calculate the total payments made by each student. Join the "Students" table with the "Payments" table and use GROUP BY to calculate the sum of payments for each student.
